# Cardiovascular_Risk_Prediction
The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes. Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavioral, and medical risk factors.

# Conclusion:
1. If we want to completely avoid any situations where the patient has heart disease, a high recall is desired. Whereas if we want to avoid treating a patient with no heart diseases a high precision is desired.
2. Assuming that in our case the patients who were incorrectly classified as suffering from heart disease are equally important since they could be indicative of some other ailment, so we want a balance between precision and recall and a high f1 score is desired.
3. Since we have added synthetic datapoints to handle the huge class imbalance in training set, the data distribution in train and test are different so the high performance of models in the train set is due to the train-test data distribution mismatch and not due to overfitting.
4. Best performance of Models on test data based on evaluation metrics for class 1:
  1. Recall - SVC
  2. Precision - Naive Bayes Classifier
  3. F1 Score - Logistic Regression, XGBoost
  4. Accuracy - Naive Bayes Classifier
